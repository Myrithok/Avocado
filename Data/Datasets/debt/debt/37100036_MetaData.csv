1,"Please note that the National Graduates Survey (NGS) 2013, class of 2009-2010 was conducted three years after graduation, whereas previous National Graduate Surveys were conducted two years after graduation. While information on graduates at the time of graduation is comparable across cycles, information on graduate's activities at the time of the interview are not directly comparable.  For example, labour market outcomes and debt repayment pertain to status three years after graduation for the NGS 2013 compared to two years after graduation for other cycles of NGS."
2,"Graduates who pursued further education after their graduation are excluded from this table."
3,"Caution should be used when comparing results over time due to differences in questions and wording. For example, information on non government sources of debt was captured from one question in the National Graduates Survey (NGS) 2005 (SL_Q22) and derived from three separate questions in the 2013 NGS (ST_Q33, ST_Q34, ST_Q35)."
4,"For the province of study, ""Canada"" includes the Territories."
5,"Dollars are rounded to the nearest 100."
6,"The reference period of the 2000 and 2005 National Graduates Surveys (NGS) is based on a calendar year and the reference period of the 2010 NGS is based on the 2009-2010 school year."
